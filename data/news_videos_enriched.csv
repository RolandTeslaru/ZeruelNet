Authorities in California say they were called to the area around 12.30pm on July 13th. This was after they were following up on a report of a quote object that appeared to be human remains. This was per written statement from the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office. Witnesses described the bear as having a face-like piece sewn onto its head, along with what appeared to be skin-like material stitched all over its body. Shortly after the call came through, authorities investigated and a corner came and removed the teddy bear. It was then taken away for further investigation. At this time, the teddy bear's origin has not yet been confirmed. However, a similar-looking teddy bear made with quote fake gore and labeled human skin bear was found listed on Etsy.
